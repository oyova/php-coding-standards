# Oyova PHP CS Fixer

This package is a wrapper for [PHP CS Fixer](https://github.com/PHP-CS-Fixer/PHP-CS-Fixer). PHP CS Fixer is used to automatically fix PHP coding standards issues and this package establishes the preferred Oyova rules and simplifies setup. To use, run the command `vendor/bin/php-cs-fixer fix` from the project root to fix all files configured in the finder. Run the command `vendor/bin/php-cs-fixer fix path/to/file.php` from the project root to fix a specific directory or file. You may wish to [create a bash alias](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-create-bash-aliases) for the command for ease of use. PHP CS Fixer should be configured in `.php-cs-fixer.php`. Refer to the `.php-cs-fixer.dist.php` file in this package as an example of usage.
